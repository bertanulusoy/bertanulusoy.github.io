title: Why this blog?
---

Hi all,
I have been working as a Software Engineer with over 8 years. So I've decided to share my knowledge with you and this  is also an opportunity to improve myself. 
Personally, I like learn new things. I will share what I learn about Data Science, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and more...

You can ask me everything about the things that I mentioned about here.

Do not spare your support and comments from me.

Continue to pursue science and knowledge.

Have a good day!
