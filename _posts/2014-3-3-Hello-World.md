Hi all,
I have been working as a Software Engineer with over 8 years. So I've decided to share my knowledge with you and this  is also an opportunity to improve myself. 
Personally, I like learn new things. I will share what I learn about Data Science, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and more...

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
